Building from Source

Here are the instructions to build the project from source:
1. Clone the Repository

Navigate to your workspace's src directory and clone the repository:
'cd ~/catkin_ws/src'
'git clone https://github.com/slva21/scale_bridge.git'

2. Install Required Packages
Make sure you have the required dependencies. On a system with ROS, you can use the following command to install the necessary packages:
'sudo apt-get install ros-$ROS_DISTRO-tf2 ros-$ROS_DISTRO-tf2-ros ros-$ROS_DISTRO-tf2-geometry-msgs'

3. Build the Package
Navigate to your workspace's root directory and build the package:
'cd ~/catkin_ws'
'catkin build'
'source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash'
